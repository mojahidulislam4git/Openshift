</br>There are two proposed standards for configuring network interfaces for Linux containers:
  </br>The container network model (CNM) 
  </br>The container network interface (CNI)

</br>The container network model (CNM) - The Container Network Model (CNM) is a standard proposed by Docker.
  </br>The CNM is built on 3 main components-
  </br> a. Sandbox - A sandbox is an isolated network stack in a container. It includes Ethernet interfaces, ports, routing tables, and DNS config.
  </br> b. Endpoint - An Endpoint joins a Sandbox to a Network.virtual network interfaces (E.g. veth). 
  </br> c. Network - Networks are a software implementation of a switch (802.1d bridge).
  


</br> NetworkController- NetworkController object provides the entry-point into libnetwork that exposes simple APIs for the users (such as Docker Engine) to allocate and manage Networks.
</br> Libnetwork- The CNM is the design doc and libnetwork is the canonical implementation.
</br> Drivers- Drivers extend the model by implementing specific network topologies such as VXLAN overlay networks.

 </br>Docker ships with several built-in drivers, known as native drivers or localdrivers-
 </br>a. bridge 
 </br>b. host
 </br>c. none
 </br>d. overlay
 </br>e. macvlan 
 </br>f. ipvlan
  
</br>a. Bridge - (Default) A bridge network uses a software bridge which lets containers connected to the same bridge network communicate, while providing isolation from containers that arenâ€™t connected to that bridge network.
</br>b. Host - The Host network driver in Docker is a networking mode that allows containers to directly use the networking stack of the Docker host machine.
</br>c. none - The none driver simply disables networking for a container, making it isolated from other containers.
</br>d. overlay - The overlay network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts. This network sits on top of (overlays) the host-specific networks, allowing containers connected to it to communicate securely when encryption is enabled.
</br>e. macvlan - Macvlan network is used to connect applications directly to the physical network. By using the macvlan network driver to assign a MAC address to each container, also allow having full TCP/Ip stack. Then, the Docker daemon routes traffic to containers by their MAC addresses. 
</br>f. ipvlan - The IPvlan driver gives users total control over both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. The VLAN driver builds on top of that in giving operators complete control of layer 2 VLAN tagging and even IPvlan L3 routing for users interested in underlay network integration.
