Introduction to Kubernetes and OpenShift -
A container is an encapsulated process that includes the required runtime dependencies for the program to run. In a container, application-specific libraries are independent of the host operating system libraries.
Libraries and functions that are not specific to the containerized application are provided by the operating system and kernel.
The provided libraries and functions help to ensure that the container remains compact, and that it can quickly execute and stop as needed.

Pros-
The main challenges that containerization aims to solve are modularizing application components for isolated development, and providing portability for an application to operate in any environment. 


Kubernetes provides a container orchestration platform to manage containers and containerized applications at scale.
Kubernetes organizes application containers into manageable units called pods, creates application or tenant isolation through namespaces, and provides integration with other components of containerized workflows, such asContinuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) 
with Jenkins.


Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) builds on Kubernetes to provide the business-class features that deliver a greater user experience and a wider tool set for enterprise needs.
RHOCP extends the features of Kubernetes by adding- robust networking solutions, platform security, authentication, a full featured web console, an integrated image registry, and several other key features in container-based workflows.
