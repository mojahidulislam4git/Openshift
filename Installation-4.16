a. Installer-provisioned Infrastructure
  - The IPI installation provides a turn-key solution and includes all the necessary infrastructure services within the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. 
  - You can provide some existing infrastructure to the cluster, but the installation program deploys all of the machines that your cluster initially needs.
b. User-provisioned Infrastructure
  - UPI allows users to provision their infrastructure pieces and deploy OpenShift on top of them.
  - Highly customizable and tunable. 
c  Assisted Installer
  -ISO discovery to identify the infrastructure set up by the user to deploy the cluster.
