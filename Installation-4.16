OpenShift Container Platform 4.16
a. Installer-provisioned Infrastructure
  - The IPI installation provides a turn-key solution and includes all the necessary infrastructure services within the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. 
  - You can provide some existing infrastructure to the cluster, but the installation program deploys all of the machines that your cluster initially needs.
b. User-provisioned Infrastructure
  - UPI allows users to provision their infrastructure pieces and deploy OpenShift on top of them.
  - Highly customizable and tunable. 
c  Assisted Installer
  -ISO discovery to identify the infrastructure set up by the user to deploy the cluster.

About OKD installation
The OKD installation program offers four methods for deploying a cluster which are detailed in the following list:

Interactive: You can deploy a cluster with the web-based Assisted Installer. This is an ideal approach for clusters with networks connected to the internet. The Assisted Installer is the easiest way to install OKD, it provides smart defaults, and it performs pre-flight validations before installing the cluster. It also provides a RESTful API for automation and advanced configuration scenarios.

Local Agent-based: You can deploy a cluster locally with the Agent-based Installer for disconnected environments or restricted networks. It provides many of the benefits of the Assisted Installer, but you must download and configure the Agent-based Installer first. Configuration is done with a command-line interface. This approach is ideal for disconnected environments.

Automated: You can deploy a cluster on installer-provisioned infrastructure. The installation program uses each cluster hostâ€™s baseboard management controller (BMC) for provisioning. You can deploy clusters in connected or disconnected environments.

Full control: You can deploy a cluster on infrastructure that you prepare and maintain, which provides maximum customizability. You can deploy clusters in connected or disconnected environments.

                                -> Bootstrap Node
install-config.yaml -> ignition -> Compute Node
                                -> worker Node

For the installation program, the program uses three sets of files during installation: 
  - An installation configuration file that is named install-config.yaml
  - Kubernetes manifests
  - Ignition config files for your machine types
